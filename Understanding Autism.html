        WHAT IS AUTISM?
    </h2>

    <p aligne="center">
         Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication, social interaction, and behaviour. It is called a "spectrum" disorder because the symptoms can range from mild to severe and can vary widely from person to person. Some people with autism may have excellent language and cognitive abilities, while others may have intellectual disabilities and struggle with basic communication skills.

    <p align="center">
        People with ASD may have difficulty with social interactions, such as making eye contact, understanding social cues and body language, and making friends. They may also engage in repetitive behaviours, such as hand-flapping or lining up

        objects, and have specific interests that they may obsess over. Sensory sensitivities are also common among people with autism, such as being overwhelmed by loud noises or bright lights.
